Description: An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed
        observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular time series
        of numeric vectors/matrices and factors. zoo's key design goals
        are independence of a particular index/date/time class and
        consistency with ts and base R by providing methods to extend
        standard generics.
