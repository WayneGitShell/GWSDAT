	* R/SpatialGrid-methods.R, R/SpatialGridDataFrame-methods.R:
	  timings

	  tests/grid.Rout.save: version update;
	  proj4string, proj4string<-, gridded, gridded<-, is.projected<-
	  are now all S4 methods;
	  SpatialGrid no longer inherits SpatialPixels directly but
	  Spatial; it is made SpatialPixels
	  by a call to setIs(), which sets the right coercion function (the
	  previous setAs() failed to do
	  this, see
	  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-September/062037.html
	  .onLoad outcommented (warnings on CRAN); updated and checked test

	  R/Spatial-methods.R, R/SpatialGridDataFrame-methods.R,
	  R/gridded.R, R/projected.R: removed .onLoad("methods") in AAA.R;
	  moved proj4string<- (again!) to S4;
	  tried to have fullgrid and fullgrid<- as S4, but failed;
	  added contains="SpatialPointsDataFrame" to SpatialPixelsDataFrame
	  so that
	  the setIs() could be removed (read ?setIs for reasons why);

	  DESCRIPTION; gridlines edits

	  constructor functions did not work properly (anymore?).

2011-07-10 13:58  edzer

	* DESCRIPTION, R/GridTopology-methods.R: updated package date;
	  improved points2grid to handle differences in
	  unique coordinates, VERY close to zero (e.g., along one column,
	  the
	  x coordinates differ very little).

2011-07-09 21:53  edzer

	* NAMESPACE, R/Spatial-methods.R, R/SpatialGrid-methods.R,
	  R/projected.R: 1. moved proj4string<- from S4 to S3; added an
	  2. as("SpatialGrid", "SpatialPoints") method.

2010-12-19 12:09  edzer

2010-12-18 16:06  edzer

	* version bump

2010-12-18 16:06  edzer

	* added length method for Spatial*DataFrame objects

2010-12-18 15:51  edzer

	* changed max = 255 into maxColorValue = 255, avoiding partial
	  argument matching

2010-12-15 17:10  edzer

	* patch to r-sig-geo of Dylan Beaudette, 15 dec 2011

2010-12-13 21:09  edzer

	* removed restriction to non-overlapping polygons from docs.

2010-12-12 21:52  edzer

	* version update; take aggregate from stats namespace; spatial
	  objects in
	  selections like points[polygon,] now also work for
	  Spatial*DataFrame as
	  selection criterion (taking the geometry of it); removed the
	  returnList=TRUE
	  option for those "over" methods that do not (yet) support it
	  (triggers error).
	  Changed vignette and tests accordingly.

2010-11-29 19:11  edzer

	* corrected inportFrom into importFrom

2010-11-22 20:47  edzer

	* small mistakes in code/docs to make sp pass check;

2010-11-22 20:23  edzer

	* added aggregate method; added coercion from SpatialGrid* to
	  SpatialPolygon*;
	  version bump; added second vignette

2010-11-22 11:38  edzer

	* added addAttrToGeom method to create a SpatialXxxDataFrame from a
	  SpatialXxx object and a data.frame, with instances for each
	  SpatialXxx.

2010-11-18 21:36  edzer

	* removed the full matrix need in .invert

2010-11-15 22:53  edzer

	* modified some of the over and pointInPol functions to catch the
	  case
	  where more than one polygon coves a point (think package cshapes)

2010-11-13 19:43  edzer

	* forgot to add & commit the docs for the geometry method,
	  mentioned in the
	  previous commit.

2010-11-13 19:37  edzer

	* match.ID in SpatialXxxDataFrame() now can be character, in which
	  case the corresponding column in the data.frame is used;
	  
	  A generic geometry() converts a SpatialXxxDataFrame into a
	  SpatialXxx.
	  
	  A generic over() provides a better overlay then overlay -- it is
	  consistent in that over(x,y) provides characteristics of y on
	  spatial
	  locations of x -- I didn't modify overlay() as too many instances
	  (including the book) rely on its inconsistency.
	  
	  Selection of objects can now be done by spatial objects: x[y]
	  returns the polygons x covered by points y, or the points x
	  inside
	  polygons y, etc.
	  
	  Related to this: x[x$dist < 30,] would work for
	  SpatialPixelsDataFrame but fail for SpatialGridDataFrame -- it
	  now works; any i-selector (first, with ,) longer than the number
	  of rows selects the cells. Selecting cells means essentially that
	  de-selected cells get assigned NA (!).
	  
	  a names methods for SpatialPolygons was added.

2010-11-08 21:26  edzer

	* reverted overlay changes back to 0.9-72 state.

2010-11-08 17:27  edzer

	* added a geometry generic and method, that returns the coercion to
	  a Spatial* object from a Spatial*DataFrame object.

2010-11-08 12:56  edzer

	* docs pass check

2010-11-08 12:34  edzer

	* modified (corrected?) overlay methods; see post on
	  r-spatial-devel;
	  added selection with Spatial object to SpatialPolygons objects.

2010-11-06 10:40  edzer

	* extended "[" method for these classes to allow the first argument
	  that is
	  of class "Spatial"; in that case, the selection will be those
	  items that
	  do not result in an NA when overlaied with the object.
	  
	  for SpatialGridDataFrame, I now allow the first index to be of
	  length
	  nrow(x@data), meaning that cell-by-cell selection takes place

2005-05-20 13:57  edzer

	* version upgrade

2005-05-20 11:19  edzer

	* The Valencia session: changed the data slot in
	  SpatialPixelDataFrame,
	  SpatialGridDataFrame and SpatialPointsDataFrame from class
	  data.frame
	  to class AttributeList, thereby removing the row.names issue
	  (which costed
	  too much time and memory).

2005-01-13 09:39  edzer

	  removed a lot
	  of setAs/setIs troubles in Points/Grids; extended grid tests.

2005-01-13 09:37  edzer

	* moved Spatial[Cell/Gridded] stuff into a single class,
	  SpatialGrid and SpatialGridDataFrame
	  added GridTopology class, which holds grid topology (offset, dim,
	  cellsize)

2005-01-07 00:42  edzer

	* three layer raster rgdal read now works; more setIs/setAs mess
	  and coercion from SPDF to data.frame if coords are not in the
	  data.frame (as when coming from a SpatialGriddedDataFrame).

	* Spatial Lines/Rings redone

2004-12-24 08:47  edzer

	* checks on coordinates needing to be numeric; this will stop
	  coordinates(meuse)
	  to work when meuse is a data.frame.

2004-12-24 08:01  edzer

	* error on coordinates() with non-numeric elements (data.frame,
	  matrix, list)

2004-12-17 20:33  edzer

	* large file split

2004-12-17 11:02  edzer

	* cleaned up NAMESPACE; tried on SP, as(x, "matrix") but gave up

2004-12-01 12:44  edzer

	* export S3method as.data.frame.SpatialPointsDataFrame;
	  went back to the old versions where S3 calls S4, and coordinates
	  get back in place

2004-11-30 21:09  rsbivand

	* getting as() working

2004-11-26 15:37  rsbivand

2004-11-08 21:52  edzer

	* coordinates are now merged in place.

2004-11-06 19:51  edzer

	* added stripping of coordinates from data.frame in
	  SpatialPointsDataFrame,
	  when set by e.g.
	  > coordinates(x) <- c("x", "y")
	  when coerced back to data.frame, coordinates are glued back to
	  the data
	  (although perhaps in a different position -- they're first then)

2004-05-26 07:13  edzer

2004-05-13 15:25  edzer

	* this file is generated from S/src/pip.c, and should be modified
	  there

2004-05-13 15:22  edzer

	* removed all files in sp/R: they are created automatically from
	  the .q
	  sources in sp/S by typing `make' in the sp directory. This was
	  necessary to create a single S-Plus/R source. Removing them
	  hopefully
	  decreases the chances of changes to .R files, being overwritten.

2004-05-13 10:24  edzer

	* map2Poly4; tests out files

2004-05-11 19:40  edzer

2004-04-21 19:50  edzer

	* time for 0.5-0.

2004-04-21 19:48  edzer

	* further S-Plus portability issues, like grep(),
	  par("col")/par("fg")

2004-04-21 13:16  edzer

	* moved main sorce from R (R-code) to S (single code for R and
	  S-Plus);
	  this requires a single make in the sp directory to create the R
	  sources
	  from S. So, no longer modifying in the R directory; use the S
	  (*.q) code
	  instead!!
	  
	  `make' also creates .Rbuildignore, with all the files that an R
	  build
	  should ignore.

2004-04-21 13:09  edzer

	* S-Plus portability scripts
